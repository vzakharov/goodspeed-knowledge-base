## **Software Developer Technical Assessment**

## **Overview**

Build an **AI-Powered Knowledge Base** \- a full-stack application where users can create and manage documents, then ask questions about them through an AI chat interface that retrieves relevant context (RAG).

You are encouraged to use AI-assisted coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, etc.). We are not testing how fast you can type \- we are evaluating your ability to make good architectural decisions, ship working software, and produce a codebase that other engineers would want to work in.

## **Tech Stack**

| Layer       | Technology                                  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Monorepo    | Turborepo                                   |
| Frontend    | React \+ Next.js                            |
| Backend API | NestJS                                      |
| Database    | Supabase (PostgreSQL \+ pgvector)           |
| AI          | OpenAI SDK (provider-agnostic \- see below) |

## **Requirements**

### **1\. Monorepo Setup (Turborepo)**

Structure the project as a Turborepo monorepo with at minimum:

- apps/web \- Next.js frontend

- apps/api \- NestJS backend

- packages/ \- shared types, config, or utilities as you see fit

The repo should have sensible Turborepo pipelines for build, dev, and lint. A new developer should be able to clone the repo, run a single setup command, and be up and running.

### **2\. Authentication**

Implement authentication using Supabase Auth (email/password is sufficient). Users should only be able to see and interact with their own documents and conversations.

### **3\. Document CRUD**

Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete documents. Each document has at minimum:

- Title

- Text content (plain text or markdown)

- Tags (optional)

- Timestamps (created, updated)

### **4\. RAG Pipeline**

When a document is created or updated, the backend should:

- Chunk the document content into appropriate segments

- Generate embeddings for each chunk

- Store the embeddings in Supabase using the pgvector extension

The chunking strategy and chunk size are up to you \- but be prepared to explain your choices.

### **5\. AI Chat Interface**

Build a chat interface where users can ask questions about their documents. The system should:

- Retrieve relevant document chunks via vector similarity search

- Include the retrieved context in the prompt sent to the AI model

- Display the AI response in a conversational UI

- Maintain conversation history within a session

### **6\. Provider-Agnostic AI Layer**

**This is a key requirement.** The AI integration must be designed so that any provider following the OpenAI API specification can be swapped in via configuration \- without changing application code. This includes but is not limited to:

- OpenAI

- Groq

- Together AI

- OpenRouter

- A local Ollama instance

Design a clean abstraction for this. We care about how you model this interface, not just that it works with one provider.

## **What We're Evaluating**

| Area                      | What we're looking for                                                                                            |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monorepo architecture** | Turborepo config, workspace structure, shared packages, DX (developer experience)                                 |
| **Code quality**          | Clean separation of concerns, readable code, consistent patterns, proper error handling                           |
| **Database design**       | Schema design, pgvector usage, RLS policies, migration strategy                                                   |
| **RAG implementation**    | Chunking strategy, embedding storage, retrieval quality, prompt construction                                      |
| **AI abstraction**        | Is the provider layer genuinely swappable? How well is the interface designed?                                    |
| **Frontend craft**        | Component structure, state management, UX sensibility \- it doesn't need to be beautiful, but it should be usable |

## **Submission**

To email:

- A Loom walkthrough talking through what you’ve built (no longer than 5 mins) to [harish@goodspeed.studio](mailto:harish@goodspeed.studio) and [clinton@goodspeed.studio](mailto:clinton@goodspeed.studio)

- A GitHub repository (public or private \- invite us if private with the email team@goodspeed.studio) containing:

1. **The complete codebase**

2. **A README** that includes:

- Setup instructions (we will run your project)

- Your architecture decisions and why you made them

- How to swap AI providers

- What you would improve or add given more time

- Link to a loom walk through of the app

- Link to a loom walk through on how you used AI to accelerate.

3. **A .env.example** with all required environment variables documented

## **Stretch Goals (Optional)**

These are not required, but if you want to demonstrate range:

- Streaming AI responses

- Persistent conversation history across sessions

- Source citations \- show which document chunks informed each answer

- File upload (PDF/TXT) with text extraction into the document system

- A simple usage/token tracking view
